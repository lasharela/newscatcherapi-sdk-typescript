        "A municipality worker inspects the damage to an apartment building a day after it was hit by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, in Rehovot, Israel, Friday, May 12, 2023. Israeli medics say a man is killed in a Palestinian rocket strike on the city of Rehovot on Wednesday, the first fatality of the... (Associated Press)\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The most violent confrontation in months between Israel and Palestinian militants continued for a third straight day on Friday, as Israeli warplanes struck targets in the Gaza Strip and militants fired rockets toward Jerusalem and southern Israel.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties on either side Friday, as foreign mediators pressed ahead with efforts to reach a cease-fire. The past few days of fighting have killed 31 Palestinians in Gaza and a 70-year-old man in central Israel.\n\nA burst of rocket fire from the Gaza Strip sent warning sirens wailing near the contested capital of Jerusalem, breaking a 12-hour lull that had raised hopes that Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations could soon be able to broker a cease-fire. Residents in Israeli settlements surrounding Jerusalem reported hearing explosions and seeing black smoke rising from the hills after an apparent missile interception.\n\nThe office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was conducting a security assessment. The Israeli military said its warplanes struck Islamic Jihad rocket launchers. Gaza residents reported blasts in farms near the southern city of Rafah.\n\nThe cross-border exchanges this week have pitted Israel against Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza after the territory's Hamas rulers. Since Tuesday, Israel says its strikes have killed five senior Islamic Jihad figures. Islamic Jihad has retaliated with over 800 rockets fire toward densely populated parts of Israel. In that time, Israel's military said it has used airstrikes to hit at least 215 targets in Gaza, including rocket and mortar launch sites and militants preparing to use them.\n\nIsraeli bombs and shells have destroyed 47 housing units, and damaged 19 so badly they were uninhabitable, leaving 165 Palestinians homeless, Gaza's housing ministry reported. In addition, nearly 300 homes sustained some damage.\n\nPalestinians on Friday surveyed the wreckage wrought by the fighting.\n\n'The dream that we built for our children, for our sons, has ended,' said Belal Bashir, a Palestinian living in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, whose family home was reduced to a heap of rubble in an airstrike late Thursday. He and his family would have been killed in the thundering explosion if they hadn't ran outside when they heard shouting, he said.\n\n'We were shocked that our house was targeted,' he added as he pulled his young children's dolls and blankets from a bomb crater.\n\nAt least 31 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been killed in the fighting, including seven children and four women, according to the U.N. humanitarian office. At least three of the children were killed by misfired Palestinian rockets, according to the Israeli military and the Palestinian Center for Rights. Over 90 Palestinians have been wounded, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.\n\nThe civilians deaths have drawn condemnation from the Arab world and concern from the United States and Europe. In its past four wars against Hamas, Israel has repeatedly faced accusations of war crimes due to the high civilian death tolls and its use of heavy weapons against the crowded enclave. Israel, in turn, contends that Palestinian militant groups use civilians as human shields by fighting in their midst.\n\nHamas, the de facto civilian government with an army of some 30,000 in Gaza, has sought to maintain its truce with Israel while attempting to keep abysmal living conditions in the blockaded enclave from spiraling since a devastating 11-day war in 2021 that killed over 260 Palestinians. The group, which seized control of Gaza in 2007, has sat out this round of fighting — as it did a similar burst of violence last summer. In a sign of restraint, Israel has limited its airstrikes to Islamic Jihad targets.\n\nBoth sides had seemed on the brink of a cease-fire before the eruption of Thursday's violence. Friday's relative calm boosted hopes of progress.\n\nHamas officials told local media that Egypt was ramping up its diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting through 'intensive contacts' with both Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nIslamic Jihad figures have sent mixed signals about the cease-fire talks. Senior official Ihsan Attaya complained early Friday that the mediators 'have been unable to provide us with any guarantees.' A sticking point has been Islamic Jihad's demands that Israel cease its policy of targeted killings, Attaya said.\n\nIslamic Jihad political bureau member Mohamad al-Hindi sounded more optimistic. From Cairo, where he traveled Thursday to hash out the details of a possible truce, he told media that he hoped both sides 'would reach a cease-fire agreement and honor it today.'\n\nThis week's battles began when Israel launched, on Tuesday, simultaneous airstrikes that killed three Islamic Jihad commanders along with some of their wives and children as they slept in their homes. Israel said it was retaliating for a barrage of rocket fire launched last week by Islamic Jihad following the death of one of its West Bank members, Khader Adnan, from a hunger strike while in Israeli custody.\n\nThe airstrikes and rockets have shifted the focus of conflict back to Gaza after months of surging violence in the occupied West Bank under Israel's most right-wing government in history.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out near-nightly arrest raids in the West Bank that have killed 109 Palestinians so far this year — the highest such death toll in two decades. At least half of the dead are affiliated with militant groups, according to a tally by The Associated Press. At least 20 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis during that time.\n\n___\n\nDeBre reported from Jerusalem",

        "The 2005 Ford GT's owner gives Bros FOURR Speed the ride of his life in what the channel considers America's most iconic supercar.",
      summary:
        "One of the most iconic of all the performance cars ever built was the \nFord\n GT40. It's most famous for going head-to-head with Ferrari in the 1960s, but the race car proved to be a fan favorite for a host of reasons.\n \nSo, it's understandable that the GT40 became the inspiration for the design of a Ford \nsupercar\n to celebrate the company's centenary. The MK1 Ford GT was the result, and it remains a great supercar according to Brian from \nthe Bros FOURR Speed YouTube channel\n. Brian gets the opportunity to ride in a beautiful 2005 Ford GT and discusses why it is an American legend.\n \n Why The Ford GT Is So Special \n \nThere were only 4,038 models of \nthe first generation Ford GT\n ever released before the end of the production run in 2006. This car was rare even back when it was first released. Now almost two decades later, they are even rarer and most desirable for exotic car collectors.\n \nLuckily for Brian, who hosts this video from Bros FOURR Speed, he's managed to get one for the day thanks to one of his many contacts, Vinny. This particular model is black with white racing stripes and looks to be in pristine condition as the camera pans around the exterior.\n \nBrian reminds us that this car has a 5.4-liter supercharged V8 engine with 550 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. He also shows us how unique the design of the mid-engine car was, with its unusual door setup and futuristic interior styling. The MK1 Ford GT came with a 6-speed manual transmission and none of the modern driver aids. These are factors that helped to make \nthe Ford GT a true driver's car\n.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: YouTube @ Bros FOURR Speed\n \n \n \n \nIt's then down to business for Brian, as he takes the car for a test drive to find out if the GT lives up to its reputation. Both he and Vinny discuss the tactile experience of driving this car. The smell from the interior, the sound of the supercharger, the ball shifter, and the feel of the clutch keep the driver's senses engaged. The supercharged engine feels modern and smooth as it moves through the gears, and the sound from \nthe V8 is a gearhead's dream\n.\n \nDespite \nthe Ford GT's supercar design and pulsating performance\n, Vinny states that he uses the car as a daily driver. That's how well-built it is. He also mentions that this is an unforgiving car, so the driver must remain focused when behind the wheel. He states that only around two-thirds of the Ford GTs have survived.\n \nGiven its rarity, \nthe MK1 Ford GT\n is worth top dollar on the used car market. \nThe price in 2023 averages out at over $375,000\n according to classic.com.\n \nSources: Bros FOURR Speed, Classic.com",

      summary:
        "Key Highlights \n:\nContinued progress has been made in advancing an investigator-initiated clinical trial to gain human proof-of-concept for Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200 in patients with renal disease\nAnnounced publication of several peer-reviewed journal articles supporting ASC inhibition as a promising therapeutic target - data continue to demonstrate that multiple types of inflammasomes are activated in various conditions (Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and injury from intracortical implants), and substantiate that extracellular release of ASC specks to neighboring cells heighten and perpetuate damaging inflammation leading to disease progression in conditions such as Parkinson's disease and alcoholic hepatitis\nAdded three internationally recognized experts in the field of glomerular disease to Renal Scientific Advisory Board, and an internationally recognized authority in the field of innate immunity to our Inflammatory Disease Scientific Advisory Board\nEnhanced our Board of Directors with addition of three biopharmaceutical leaders with impeccable credentials and a proven track record of success\n \nWESTON, Fla., May 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZVSA; 'ZyVersa'), a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drugs for treatment of patients with renal and inflammatory diseases who have unmet medical needs, provides a corporate update and reports financial results for the first quarter of 2023 ending March 31, 2023.\n'This is a very exciting time in the growth and evolution of ZyVersa as we seek to build shareholder value through development of first-in-class drugs at the forefront of innovation for renal and inflammatory diseases,' said Stephen C. Glover, Co-founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of ZyVersa. 'We are currently advancing a dynamic pipeline of drug candidates with multiple programs built around our two proprietary technologies – Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200 for treatment of kidney diseases and Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100 for treatment of multiple CNS and other inflammatory diseases. We believe that both technologies have transformative potential, enabling development of drugs for patients who have limited or no therapeutic options.'\nMr. Glover continued: 'Highlighting our Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100, ZyVersa expects to complete IC 100's preclinical program this year, with an Investigational New Drug ('IND') submission anticipated in second quarter of 2024. We were pleased to report publication of data in several peer-reviewed journal articles demonstrating the role of ASC specks in heightening and perpetuating damaging inflammation in neurological conditions (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury), and in alcoholic hepatitis. These data support the therapeutic potential of inhibiting ASC and ASC specks with IC 100 to control inflammation associated with various inflammatory diseases.'\n'Regarding Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200, ZyVersa continues to leverage relationships with experts in the field of renal disease,' stated Mr. Glover. 'To that end, we welcomed three new members to our Renal Disease Scientific Advisory Board. We look forward to benefitting from their decades of experience as we advance our investigator-initiated trial to evaluate VAR 200 in patients with renal disease, expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.'\nFIRST QUARTER AND RECENT PROGRAM UPDATES\nTargeting Renal Disease with Phase 2a-Ready Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200\nContinued progress is being made to launch an investigator-initiated clinical trial in patients with renal disease to gain human proof-of-concept for Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200, with trial initiation expected in the fourth quarter of 2023\nAdded to ZyVersa's Renal Scientific Advisory Board (1) Dr. Daniel C. Cattran, Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto; (2) Dr. Fernando C. Fervenza, Professor of Medicine, Mayo Graduate School of Medicine and Director of the Nephrology Collaborative Group; and (3) Dr. Richard J. Glassock, Professor Emeritus, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA\nInflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100: Targeting Inflammation Associated with Multiple CNS and Other Inflammatory Diseases\nOn track to complete IND-enabling preclinical studies by end of year, with the goal of filing an IND application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the second quarter of 2024\nHighlighted peer-reviewed journal articles supporting the potential of ASC inhibition to control damaging inflammation associated with numerous diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and alcohol induced hepatitis\nAdded to ZyVersa's Inflammatory Disease Scientific Advisory Board Dr. Douglas Golenbock, The Neil and Margery Blacklow Chair in Infectious Diseases and Immunology, and Professor and Chief, Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at the UMass Chan Medical School\nFIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSince its inception in 2014 through March 31, 2023, ZyVersa has not generated any revenue and has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from its operations. Based on our current operating plan, we expect our cash of $1.3 million as of March 31, 2023, will only be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements on a month-to-month basis. ZyVersa will need additional financing to support its continuing operations. ZyVersa will seek to fund its operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include government grants and collaborations with third parties.\nResearch and development expenses were consistent at approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 ('Successor Period'), with an immaterial decrease of $11 thousand or 1.0% from the three months ended March 31, 2022 ('Predecessor Period').\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $1.2 million or 53.7% from $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $0.4 million in director and officer insurance, a $0.4 million increase in marketing costs for investor and public relations, and $0.4 million in payments for the Effectiveness Failure related to the PIPE shares.\nNet losses were approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, with an improvement of $0.2 million or 5.5% compared to a net loss of approximately $3.7M, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 benefited from a $1.0 Million deferred tax benefit compared to none for the year earlier period.\nAbout ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc.\nZyVersa (Nasdaq: ZVSA) is a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced, proprietary technologies to develop first-in-class drugs for patients with renal and inflammatory diseases who have significant unmet medical needs.

      summary:
        "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Jesper Fast could only shake his head in disbelief after missing an early open-net putaway, a play that took on growing weight as the Carolina Hurricanes found themselves in an overtime.\n\n'Yeah, it was hard to get over that one,' Fast said.\n\nHe certainly made amends, pushing the Hurricanes through to the Eastern Conference final and eliminating the New Jersey Devils.\n\nFast deflected in a shot by Jesperi Kotkaniemi on a power play at 7:09 of overtime, lifting the Hurricanes to a series-ending 3-2 victory Thursday night.\n\nFast's deflection while shielding Akira Schmid set off a celebration for the Hurricanes, who never led until the final play and twice trailed by a goal before winning the best-of-seven series 4-1.\n\nIn the first tight game of the second-round matchup, Fast's winner came after New Jersey's Jonas Siegenthaler was sent to the box for a delay-of-game penalty for sending a puck out of play from his own zone. It also came with Fast in his second game back on the power-play unit.\n\n'I know that he was shaking his head in the first period,' Carolina defenseman Jaccob Slavin said, 'but to get it in the end is awesome for him.'\n\nSlavin and Brent Burns also scored for Carolina, and Frederik Andersen made 27 saves.\n\nThis marks Carolina's first trip to the Eastern Conference final since 2019, which came during Rod Brind'Amour's first season as coach. The Hurricanes are now in their fifth straight playoff season, a veteran group that has pushed through two series despite losing multiple scoring forwards.\n\nThey'll next face the winner of the Florida-Toronto series, with the Panthers leading that one 3-1.\n\n'We're stacking memories here, and they're giving them to me, too,' said Brind'Amour, the captain on Carolina's Stanley Cup winner in 2006. 'So it's pretty special.'\n\nDawson Mercer and Timo Meier scored for New Jersey. Schmid stopped 36 shots after being chased early in the second in Game 1 here and then after the second in Game 2.\n\n'I said this morning they'd give me everything they had,' Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. 'They gave me everything they had.'\n\nThe first four games of the series had been filled by lopsided results, with each decided by at least four goals and a starting goaltender chased early.\n\nThe Hurricanes had been in this position in Round 1, with a chance to close out the New York Islanders on home ice in Game 5. They lost that one and instead had to clinch the series with an overtime road win in Game 6.\n\nThis time, they needed a dramatic finish to avoid a repeat.\n\nThe Devils' exit comes in a season where a young group arrived to postseason contention earlier than expected.\n\nNew Jersey finished one point behind the Hurricanes in the Metropolitan Division for the league's third-best point total (112) and the franchise's first playoff appearance in five years, then pushed past the rival New York Rangers in seven games despite falling behind 0-2 for its first playoff series win since 2012.\n\n'We knew we had to play better and I think the whole team bought in,' Devils captain Nico Hischier said. 'The effort was there and we had our chances.'\n\nMISSED CHANCES\n\nBoth teams missed on apparent easy putaways that loomed large as the game pushed into OT.\n\nThe Hurricanes' early chances included Seth Jarvis' deflection banging off the right post roughly 6 minutes in. Then came Paul Stastny finding Fast at the top of the crease — only to see Fast lift the puck over the exposed net in a play.\n\n'You've just got to have a short memory,' Fast said. 'It was hard at the time but you've just got to focus on the next shift.'\n\nThe Devils' frustrating moment came in a wild second-period sequence.\n\nMeier stole possession behind the Carolina net and started a pass-heavy sequence near the crease before the puck found its way back to him on the opposite side for a putaway chance. But Meier send the puck harmlessly through the crease.\n\n'When Timo missed the empty net to make it 3-1, I thought and I said this might come back to haunt us,' Ruff said.\n\nBANGED-UP STAR\n\nRuff said he didn't know if Devils star forward Jack Hughes would be ready due to an upper-body injury. Hughes saw 14:16 of ice time and got one shot.\n\n'I'm going to give him a lot of credit,' Ruff said. 'I didn't think he was going to be able to play tonight.'\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\nMcLeod had a huge defensive play with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the third, getting his stick in to disrupt Fast's attempt on an empty goal after Schmid had lost the puck behind the net. … Carolina finished with a 39-29 shot advantage. … The Devils were 1 for 24 on the power play this season against the Hurricanes before Meier's second-period goal. … Carolina's Jordan Martinook assisted Slavin's second-period goal, pushing him to 10 points in the series after a scoreless first round. … Former North Carolina State and current Buffalo Bills running back Nyheim Hines sounded the pregame storm-warning siren for the Hurricanes to take the ice.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\n___\n\nAP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

      summary:
        "The thing about 'cap and trade' legislation is, that it is so chock-full of technical language that is difficult for anyone but a policy wonk to follow. 'Global warming' legislation has been shot down in the Congress, but has passed on a statewide level in California. It is taking a long time to implement in the Golden State partially due to the law's complexity, but also due to the fact that so many groups and individuals are trying to profit from it. The following is an update on California 'cap and trade' litigation, and how it has POTENTIAL to bring back the bad science of climate change to nationwide application. This needs watching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, center, signs the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2006, in San Francisco. Schwarzenegger signed into law a sweeping global warming initiative that imposes the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions, saying the effort kicks off 'a bold new era of environmental protection.' Standing on picturesque Treasure Island with San Francisco's skyline in the background, Schwarzenegger called the fight against global warming one of the most important issues of modern times. (AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\n\n: \n\n\nHeritage Foundation\n and the \nNew York Times\n follow \nmy story last week\n on the San Francisco judge who has put a temporary stop to the enforcement of California's 'cap and trade' law, AB 32. What is clear is: It is too soon for global warming 'skeptics' to celebrate. California's 'cap and trade' law still has plenty of legal 'legs,' because there is too much money to be made by the interested parties. California taxpayers beware: Your pockets are going to be picked (again.) There is even a possibility the California legal outcomes could have national impact\n.\n\n\nAfter having the ruling and lawsuit reviewed by a number of attorneys and interested parties, it is clear there are still more expensive and business-killing 'boondoggles' to 'cap and trade' that never got much publicity in the long-running battle to get the AB32 legislation passed in California:\n\n\nHere is what is potentially still to come in California 'cap and trade:'\n\n\nCalifornia's AB32 'Cap and Trade' Scope May Be Broadened \n\n\nAs \nThomas Lifson at American Thinker\n rightfully pointed out last week, the initial 'jubilation' by climate 'realists' that AB32 is temporarily suspended by San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith from taking effect should be tempered. If the environmental groups bringing the lawsuit in San Francisco are eventually successful, the 'cap and trade' law could be much more broadly applied:\n\n\nThe group Association of Irritated \nResidents\n (AIR) is a far left environmental group. The court decision is \nhere\n.\n\n\n: \nAIR argues that the Air Resources Board (ARB) did not go far enough in its regulations. They want agriculture along with many other industries included in the regulations instead of just the major emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.\n \n\n\nFor example, the opinion states on page 10 that 'Petitioners first allege that ARB failed to include direct emissions reduction measures from the agricultural sector'. (AIR is a San Joaquin valley based group which files \nsuits\n against the EPA and other regulatory bodies to try to clean up the valley air.)\n \n\n\nIt is apparent that this is an effort to get the Air Resources Board to broaden its regulations to include a much larger number of \nbusinesses\n. If AIR can get the ARB to agree, the net effect would be to impose much more draconian GHG regulations on California businesses.\n\n\nLobbying for Global warming 'Reparations' to 'Impacted' Parties or Community Groups\n\n\nBob White, a Tea party/9-12 organizer in California, was kind enough to pass along some very good history on the attempts to add climate 'reparations' to California law during the time AB32 was working its way through the legislature. These measures did not get much attention at the time, which is shocking considering the potentially huge transfer of taxpayer wealth to environmental 'activist' groups.\n\n\n'In an effort to ensure California low-income communities get their fair share of resources from AB 32, CRPE became a co-sponsor of AB 1405 (De Leon) [AB 1405 should link to along with Coalition for Clean Air, California State Office of the NAACP, and the Greenlining Institute. AB 1405 seeks to create a Community Benefits Fund (CBF) that requires 30% of any revenues from the implementation of AB 32 go into a fund for low income and disproportionately impacted communities. The idea behind the Fund is to provide resources for communities that already bear disproportionate burdens of pollution and global warming. The fund could be used to accelerate greenhouse gas emission reductions or mitigate direct health impacts of climate change in low-income communities\n.'\n\n\nIt turns out, there were two attempts to pass 'climate reparations' to go along with AB 32, one to pay out 30% to community groups unknown, and an amendment tried for a 10% pay-out. To his credit, Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed each of them. How likely is it that 'green' governor Jerry Brown will veto such a measure if it comes before him?\n\n\n9\nth\n Circuit Appeals Court Ruling May Also Broaden the Scope of AB32\n\n\nJust as the San Francisco Superior Court was ruling on aspects of AB32, the 9\nth\n Circuit of Appeals also weighed in with a decision that confuses the issue even more. (Since at least one of the plaintiffs in the federal case is 'shared' by the San Francisco lawsuit, it appears the environmental groups may be 'shopping' their agenda through state and federal courts concurrently.)\n\n\nThe federal appeals panel agreed with California Central Valley environmental groups that the Environmental Protection Agency needs to issue more agency rulings to allow regulations for \nsuch things as vehicle mileage:\n\n\nThe groups raise three issues in their petition for review: \n\n\n– They contend EPA's failure to order California to submit a revised attainment plan for the South Coast (Los Angeles) area after it disapproved a 2003 attainment plan was arbitrary and capricious. \n\n\n– They contend EPA's approval of a plan designed to reduce emissions from pesticide applications violates the Clean Air Act because the plan lacks enforceable commitments. \n\n\n– They contend EPA violated the Clean Air Act by failing to require transportation control measures to combat any increase in vehicle miles traveled. \n\n\nThe federal appeals court says it agrees with all three arguments. \n\n\nThe EPA staff's ability to make new regulations 'by memo,' without a vote of Congress, poses an unconstitutional 'end-around' that is \nbeing challenged by the Chamber of Commerce and some House Republicans.\n\n\n'Cap and Trade' should be called 'Cap, Trade and Transfer (Wealth)'\n\n\nWhat this all shows, again, is that 'cap and trade' legislation has nothing to do with saving the planet. The law is, and always has been, a money 'cow' to be milked by certain preferred parties and opportunists. \n\n\nTo oversimplify but hopefully clarify this a bit further: \n\n\nCalifornia businesses and residents will be heavily impacted by fees, standards and permitting procedures if 'cap and trade' law AB 32 is ever put into full effect. With 193 companies leaving the state just last year, it is anticipated that AB32, once in full force and effect, will send even more businesses over the border. \n\n\nThe \n'cap'\n on the supposedly-toxic carbon dioxide emissions of businesses require that industries reduce emissions and re-tool with expensive new equipment to meet very tough standards that are difficult, if not impossible to meet. \n\n\nThe \n'trade' is a huge scam which receives little coverage from mainstream media and television networks. NBC has a conflict of interest: \nThe 'trade' makes money for a group of investors and brokers who will make money buying, selling and holding 'carbon credits' which companies and users will be able to purchase to 'offset' their supposed harm to the environment when they are unable to meet the unattainable standards. A \ncontroversial new 'industry'\n of \ncarbon credit traders\n has sprung up in anticipation of credit exchanging. For example, \nstate records show hedge fund manager Thomas Steyer\n in San Francisco paid at least $5 million to fight a ballot proposition against AB32 last fall. Hollywood stars and industry celebrities like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Sergei Brin of Google helped raise $36 million overall to keep AB32 in place. It is naÃ¯ve to believe that such corporate titans and investors are paying such huge sums simply trying to save the planet.\n\n\nMr. Steyer, along with \nAl Gore,\n \nGeneral Electric\n (which owns NBC) and many other Obama administration cronies\n, stand to make BILLIONS from carbon credit trading if/when AB 32 takes effect.\n Carbon credit trading has \nfoundered at a national level\n with the failure to pass a bill in Congress. It is unclear how the California trading will proceed. \n\n\nClimate 'Reparations' Fail at Internationale Level, but May Be Approved in California\n \n\n\nThe California idea of 'reparations' to 'injured' climate victims is not new. It had been discussed before, but officially became part of the global warming climate treaty meme\n during the 1992 'Rio Summit.\n\n\nThose of us who have followed the Copenhagen (December 2009) and Cancun (December 2010) international climate conferences sponsored by the United Nations are very well aware that a huge component of the proposed international climate 'treaty' is/was 'reparations' to third world countries to supposedly 'help' them to recover from the impacts of global warming.\n\n\n(Never mind the 'inconvenient facts' that global warming is not occurring, there is now global cooling and no climate change is caused by humans) is causing a problem with any approval of such a treaty.\n\n\nThe other problem with 'reparations' is, because they are totally bogus, they are based on no factual 'standard' and would simply constitute an unaccountable transfer of wealth from rich to poor countries. (Read: More vacation homes and Ferraris for banana republic dictators.)\n\n\n(You might remember one of my stories from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, in which be-turbaned African dictators from random small nations were pounding on conference tables demanding an eye-goggling \n$722 billion from the United States\n in 'reparations,' a proposal that thankfully, went nowhere. The climate treaty 'bandits' \nwent home empty-handed\n in 2009. Again in Cancun 2010, \nno treaty was signed\n.)\n\n\nWill 'Cap and Trade' Rise from the 'Ashes' Nationally Due to California Legal Action?\n\n\nWhat could potentially happen, if the San Francisco lawsuit is successful, is that statewide rules for 'capping' carbon dioxide emissions could be extended in much more detail, to agri-business, individual users of energy, and specific geographic areas.\n\n\nIf the legislature takes action on 'reparations' again, California governor Jerry Brown is not likely to veto them. There would ensue a 'money grab' from an alphabet soup of 'entitled' groups and individuals.\n\n\nIf the federal EPA follows the 9\nth\n Circuit Court ruling, there could issue more stringent energy regulations tied to consumer and business usage. Would they apply just to California due to AB 32 or \nmight they be construed nationwide?\n \n\n\nGood questions to ask:\n Who are these environmental groups bringing these lawsuits? Who do they represent? If they get 10 or 20 or 30 percent of taxes taken in from AB32, what are they going to do with the money? Who determines who gets to be 'impacted' by global warming in California and deserves 'reparations?' This is what killed the climate treaty internationally, but here in California, it's not politically-correct to question the theory of 'man-caused' climate change. California liberals are still stuck in the 80s with climate theories. Out here, Al Gore still gets invites to political fundraisers, for people like Jerry Brown and Barbara Boxer, who still get elected. That should tell you a LOT. These are very inconvenient questions and no one in the California media or legislature seems to be asking them.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n'Climate Justice [finally] California Judge Faults AB 32 Cap and Trade Law'\n \n\n\nSan Francisco Superior Court ruling by Judge Ernest Goldsmith \nhere.\n\n\n'\nCalifornia Appeals Court Demands EPA Restrict Driving in California\n'\n\n\n9\nth\n Circuit Court of Appeals ruling \nhere",

      summary:
        "With a recent Historic Preservation Award from the Montana Historical Society and a freshly minted listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the Como Schoolhouse near Darby sure has a lot to celebrate these days.\nNestled among towering Ponderosa pine trees, not far from the banks of the Bitterroot River, the 120-year-old schoolhouse was officially added to the National Register of Historic Places in December 2022. On May 21 at 6 p.m., the Como Schoolhouse Association will celebrate the designation with the dedication of an official plaque, marking the schoolhouse's place on the historic registry. The plaque was recently mounted on a boulder outside the historic schoolhouse. The event will serve as an unveiling to the community as well as an opportunity for people to tour the grounds and learn more about the local landmark.\n'This is a big milestone,' said Brooke Angst, Como Schoolhouse Association secretary and board member. 'The group that has been working for a long time to preserve the history of the schoolhouse in this small community is really proud to have solidified the schoolhouse's existence and its history within the official record.'\n \nThe Como Schoolhouse was built in 1902 on land donated by Mary and Frank Cook for the purpose of a public school. In 1921 the Como School District consolidated with Darby District, ending the building's use as a school. The building is owned by the nonprofit Como Schoolhouse Corporation and is currently used as a community center.\nThe Como Schoolhouse Association began pursuing the listing in the National Register of Historic Places early in 2022, and worked with local historian Janene Caywood to develop an application package which was then submitted to the Montana State Historical Preservation Office. The Montana State Historic Preservation Office nominates eligible properties to the National Register of Historic Places. The application was submitted to the National Register on Oct. 17, 2022.\nAuthorized under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Register includes districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and culture. Although the National Register is a program of the National Park Service, it is administered at the state level by each respective state. In addition to the recognition that listing provides, registered properties are afforded a measure of protection from projects that are funded, licensed, or executed by the federal government. National Register properties may also be eligible for historic preservation tax incentives.\n'We're just excited to have this history that is so important to our small community be recognized as a part of history,' Angst said. 'No matter what happens to the physical building, and what happens to us, this schoolhouse will officially be in the historic registry forever. And so I think that that kind of puts us on the map. It's nice to have that recognition.'\nThe May 21 dedication follows the annual Como Schoolhouse Association membership meeting at 5 p.m., and will include a community potluck dinner. The public is encouraged to attend, bring a dish to share with the crowd and explore the historic grounds with friends and neighbors.\n'There's so much change coming into the valley that I hope people understand that there are some really important historical staples that we have, and that we do have people around new and old that value that history and want to preserve it,' Angst said. 'We found something really wonderful and want to preserve it and make sure that it lives on.'\n \n \n \nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.",

      excerpt: 'Home / Wire Join thousands already receiving our daily newsletter.',
      summary:
        "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Thursday backed a California animal cruelty law that requires more space for breeding pigs, a ruling the pork industry says will lead to higher costs nationwide for pork chops and bacon.\n\n'While the Constitution addresses many weighty issues, the type of pork chops California merchants may sell is not on that list,' Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in an opinion for the court.\n\nIndustry groups have said the law would mean expensive, industry-wide changes even though a majority of the farms where pigs are raised are not in California, the nation's most populous state, but instead in the Midwest and North Carolina.\n\nA majority of the high court agreed that lower courts had correctly dismissed pork producers' challenge to the law. Both liberal and conservative justices were a part of the majority, though they were not united in their reasoning.\n\nGorsuch said the pork producers challenging the law were asking the justices to 'fashion two new and more aggressive constitutional restrictions on the ability of States to regulate goods sold within their borders.' The justices declined.\n\nFour justices would have sent the case back to continue in lower courts. Chief Justice John Roberts was joined in that view by fellow conservative justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh and liberal Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson.\n\nDuring arguments in the case in October, liberal and conservative justices underscored the potential reach of the case. Some worried whether greenlighting the animal cruelty law would give state legislators a license to pass laws targeting practices they disapprove of, such as a law that says a product cannot be sold in the state if workers who made it are not vaccinated or are not in the country legally. They also worried about the reverse: How many state laws would be called into question if California's law were not permitted?\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement that the ruling 'affirms states' important role in regulating goods sold within their borders' and that it 'means that California can continue to have in place humane and commonsense standards, instead of the extreme confinement pushed by some pork producers.'\n\nThe case before the court involved California's Proposition 12, which voters passed in 2018. It said that pork sold in the state needs to come from pigs whose mothers were raised with at least 24 square feet of space, with the ability to lie down and turn around. That rules out confined 'gestation crates,' metal enclosures that are common in the pork industry.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation and the Iowa-based National Pork Producers Council sued. They said that while Californians consume 13% of the pork eaten in the United States, nearly 100% of it comes from hogs raised outside the state, including in Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and North Carolina. The vast majority of sows, meanwhile, are not raised under conditions that would meet Proposition 12's standards.\n\nScott Hays, the president of the National Pork Producers Council said in a statement following the ruling that the group was 'very disappointed' with the court's opinion. 'Allowing state overreach will increase prices for consumers and drive small farms out of business, leading to more consolidation,' he wrote.\n\nThe Biden administration had urged the justices to side with pork producers, telling the court in written filings that Proposition 12 would be a 'wholesale change in how pork is raised and marketed in this country' and that it has 'thrown a giant wrench' into the nation's pork market.\n\nPork producers argued that 72% of farmers use individual pens for sows that do not allow them to turn around and that even farmers who house sows in larger group pens do not provide the space California would require.\n\nThey also say that the way the pork market works, with cuts of meat from various producers being combined before sale, it is likely all pork would have to meet California standards, regardless of where it is sold. Complying with Proposition 12 could cost the industry $290 million to $350 million, they said.\n\nAnimals rights groups cheered the decision.\n\n'We're delighted that the Supreme Court has upheld California Proposition 12 — the nation's strongest farm animal welfare law — and made clear that preventing animal cruelty and protecting public health are core functions of our state governments,' the president of the Humane Society of the United States, Kitty Block, wrote in a statement. The organization had backed Proposition 12 and was a participant in the case.",

I took a week away from my work devices after that marathon 24-hour end to the legislative session.\nIn the meantime, if you're on Twitter as much as I am, you might have noticed a significant uptick in tweets from some statewide electoral hopefuls. Once the General Assembly adjourns their session, it's free reign to begin soliciting campaign donations. The 2024 election is right around the corner!\nLoad Error\nLet's catch up.\n\nForwarded this letter from a friend? Sign up for Hoosier Politics here.\nAttention HamCo and beyond: Indiana's 5th Congressional District race is shaping up. Yes, the election still a year and a half away.\nU.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz has already said she won't run again, nor does she have plans to run for Mike Braun's U.S. Senate seat opening up. No one's yet raised their hand to run against U.S. Rep. Jim Banks for Braun's seat. Braun is running for governor.\nNoblesville state Rep. Chuck Goodrich and Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings have launched campaigns for Spartz's seat within the last couple weeks. Goodrich, CEO of Gaylor Electric, has already loaned himself $1 million. Read about them here.\nFormer state schools superintendent Jennifer McCormick is the first Democrat to enter the race for Indiana governor.\nThough she only flipped parties in 2021, the Indiana GOP has considered her a Democrat since 2020, when she started endorsing a slew of Democratic candidates ― including opponents to House Speaker Todd Huston and Gov. Eric Holcomb.\nIndiana hasn't had a Democratic governor since 2005, when Joe Kernan served out the remainder of the late Frank O'Bannon's second term.\nHolcomb can't run again due to term limits. On the Republican ticket so far are Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, U.S. Sen. Mike Braun and Fort Wayne businessman Eric Doden. Donald Rainwater is running as a libertarian.\nBraun and Doden are neck-and-neck on fundraising: $2.9 million and $2.8 million in their coffers, respectively.\nQuick recaps from the municipal primary:\n\nThe legislature hit on a lot of big topics this session, from education spending to transgender youth to health care affordability.\nBut if you're wondering, how exactly is my life going to change? Cate Charron and I put that list together.\nAnd as a quick follow-up, she got the deets about a new highway speed camera program lawmakers approved.\nIndiana's Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young did not get President Donald Trump's endorsement for reelection in 2022. Now he's dishing it back.\nOn CNN Thursday, Young said he will not support Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Asked why, he said, \"Where do I begin?\"\nReminder: Young famously bucked Trump by saying, before the Capitol attack, he was voting to certify the Electoral College results on Jan. 6.\nIt may be a stretch to include this in a political letter, but hey, it's hundreds of millions of tax dollars, and we're happy it's done.\nNow that the I-65/I-70 North Split interchange in downtown Indianapolis is open, \"beautification\" can begin.

      excerpt:
        'Whether you are the acquiring or target party, an M&A deal can be a powerful way to achieve your goals as a business owner in 2023 and beyond.',
      summary:
        "Member at \nSills Cummis & Gross P.C.\n\n\ngetty\n \nIf your business is considering a merger or acquisition as a target or buyer in 2023, here are some tips to focus on:\n \nIf you are looking to potentially acquire another business, you must first begin with identifying a target. In order to do this, you want to look at the sector and understand who the respective competitors are in that space. Additionally, you should seek to explore unique attributes and geographies of various potential targets.\n \nConsider whether it complements existing areas of your organization. Does the target excel in areas your company lacks? Does the target have distribution centers in areas of the world your company is looking to target?\n\n\n\n\nIf, as a business owner, your business is targeted for potential acquisition, you should ask yourself the same questions (but from a slightly different vantage point). How could the resources from this larger company help your organization excel and grow? Do the resources from the potential acquiring organization seem attractive for the future of your company?\n \n2. Analyze financials and conduct due diligence.\n\n\nOnce you have either identified target companies for potential acquisition or your company has been identified as said target, the next step is financials and due diligence.\n \nAt this stage, acquirers must decide how they are conducting due diligence—with a law firm? an investment bank? key internal offices? all of the above? It is essential to conduct thorough due diligence to ensure no surprises after the deal closes. Some items that require focus during this period include the target's financials (including profit margins, revenue and debt).\n \nAdditionally, as the business owner of the acquiring organization, you should focus on the target company's assets and liabilities, including any equipment, intellectual property or real estate holdings. For optimal merger success, you should also analyze the target company's customer base, market position and growth potential.\n\n\nAs the target organization, you will need to make sure all of your internal metrics and processes are in order to ensure the best chance of success in this stage.\n\n\nAs the acquiring company, your next step is putting together a letter of intent (LOI) or a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that outlines the key terms and contingencies for a potential deal. These key terms and contingencies include the due diligence period, financing contingency period and/or an approvals contingency period (if special licenses or permits are required for the acquirer to operate the target upon transaction completion).\n\n\n3. Integrate the two companies.\n\n\nAs a business owner, once you identify your target for acquisition, you should look into how to integrate the two companies. If, on the other hand, your organization is to potentially be acquired, it is of paramount importance that you consider this from your vantage point. Both parties, in evaluating integration possibilities, should consider their individual and collective interests—including what the culture is like at each organization, among other factors.\n\n\nAdditionally, you will want to consider the management style of the other organization, and what it would look like to merge with an organization with said management style. What key executives remain? If you are the target company, how will employees at your organization react to any proposed changes?\n\n\nAfter considering these initial questions, the next step for the acquiring party involves creating a written plan about corporate integration. This plan may include items such as whether the acquirer will move all of the executives from the target to their main headquarters, whether an in-person, remote or hybrid work style will be deployed, whether the target's footprint will be reduced (office space), etc.\n\n\nAt this stage, it is critical that delineated policies ensure the target will be run like a top-tier organization. As the target business owner, you should be ready to understand how the acquiring party intends to streamline the organizations' systems, and how this fits within the larger plan.\n\n\n4. Ensure mutual success and leverage brand equity.\n\n\nMyriad opportunities for leveraging the target company's brand equity exist. To begin, you should decide whether to fold the target directly into your business or keep it as a separate subsidiary (continuing to use its own name). At this stage, you can explore ways to integrate the target's product or services into your company's offerings. Ideally, these integrations would create more opportunities and value for your customers, shareholders and team members.\n\n\nIt is important to understand the goals of both organizations in this process, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each. Ideally, the merger or acquisition will create opportunities to leverage the strengths of both organizations to form a more successful parent organization.\n\n\nWith this, the success of an M&A deal hinges on meticulous planning and careful, measured execution. Whether you are the acquiring or target party, it is important to approach the potential deal from all angles and decide whether the merger or acquisition makes sense from a financial standpoint as well as a cultural and service-offering perspective. By keeping the above tips in mind, an M&A deal can be a powerful way to achieve your goals as a business owner in 2023 and beyond.\n\n\nForbes Business Council\n is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. \nDo I qualify?",

        "Oklahoma City, Edmond, Norman, Piedmont, Yukon and Guthrie are among communities in Oklahoma that have promoted May as National Bike Month, including plans for people to take part in National Bike to Work Day on May 19. (Photo by Marianna Lutkova on Unsplash)\n \nAs Oklahoma coasts toward warm weather season, people might want to dust off bikes and helmets and air up tires to participate in National Bike Month.\n\n\nBike to Work Week will roll in on May 15 and continue through May 21. For those who would like to take part, but maybe only for a day, National Bike to Work Day has been set for May 19.\n\n\nAccording to local officials, Oklahoma City, Edmond, Norman, Piedmont, Yukon and Guthrie are among communities in the Sooner State that have launched plans for group rides or other events.\n\n\nThere will be no fewer than five organized group rides in Oklahoma City on the morning of May 19, beginning in the Plaza District, Mesta Park, at the 30th Street Market, in the Wheeler District, and at the Oklahoma Science Museum. All five routes will end at Bicentennial Park downtown, where riders and others will convene between 7:45 a.m. and 9 a.m. to swap stories and enjoy free drinks provided by Junction Coffee.\n\n\n'Looking for a group ride? Join one of many group rides from various neighborhoods around the metro. Or, rally your local bicycling community and start your own group ride and meet us downtown at Bicentennial Park,' the city said in a news release.\n\n\nFind out more online at \nacogok.org/bikecentral\n.\n\n\nSunday, May 21, is Bike to Place of Worship Day.\n\n\nOrganizers say the overriding goal of Bike Month is to educate people young and old about benefits of bicycling, while also teaching safe riding practices and promoting resources available to cyclists. In central Oklahoma, it's hosted by the Association of Central Oklahoma Governments. The city of Oklahoma City is a major supporter and sponsor.\n\n\nNotably, the city is beginning to reap benefits of a large, multi-year investment in bike lanes and other bike infrastructure as part of its ongoing 'active transportation' community plan. It also has invested in an educational campaign, including outreach events designed to help ensure the safety not only of bicyclists but also pedestrians. Details can be found at watchformeok.org.\n\n\nThe educational campaign was planned in tandem with a project phase, which included installation of more than 10 miles of bicycle facilities on N. Shartel Avenue, Exchange Avenue, Westwood Boulevard, N. 13th Street, NW Fourth Street and W. Sheridan Avenue. Goals were to make the streets safer and more accessible to bicyclists and pedestrians.\n\n\n'By the end of May, several of the new bike facilities will have been installed and will be available for bicyclists to enjoy during Bike Month and beyond,' the city said.\n\nd",

        'With her shows no longer on, 19 Kids and Counting and Counting On star Jessa Duggar has been using social media to keep her fans up to date with her life. She often shares photos and videos of her husband, Ben Seewald, and their four children - Spurgeon, 7, Henry, 6, Ivy, 3, and Fern, one. Of course, sharing her personal life to millions of people opens her up to shaming, and she\'s seen her fair share of it. She\'s been criticized for the haircut she gave her child, letting her kids use a cell phone, her toddler\'s dirty feet, her kid having an accident, even for letting her kids make crafts. Well now, the 30-year-old reality star is under fire for installing a new device in her home to make her life easier.\n\nJessa shared video on her Instagram that said, "No more \'Please shut the door.\' Hello springtime, goodbye flies in my kitchen." In it, she first shows Henry and Ivy coming in through their home\'s side doors, which the kids leave open. She next shows a device that automatically closes doors, then she shows Fern opening the door which closes on its own.\n\nThe excited mom captioned the clip, "Some dreams do come true," adding, "Took about 2 hrs for me to figure out how to put that baby on the door, but I got it in the end."',

      excerpt:
        'Book Club: The Next Chapter is fluff & it will occasionally pull on the heartstrings, while also serving as a beautiful travel commercial for Italy.',
      summary:
        "Some movies are heartfelt and moving despite not having much of a story at all, and Book Club: The Next Chapter is one such film. The sequel to 2018's Book Club, The Next Chapter sees the characters on a trip to Italy as they enter the next stage in their lives and reaffirm their friendship. It's a lovely, warm film overall, though it lingers for longer than need be and has no major conflict. Directed by Bill Holderman from a screenplay he co-wrote with Erin Simms, Book Club: The Next Chapter is fluff, but if you're willing to go along for the ride, it will occasionally pull on the heartstrings, while also serving as a beautiful travel commercial for Italy.\nThe film begins by covering what the four friends — Vivian (Jane Fonda), Diane (Diane Keaton), Sharon (Candice Bergen), and Carol (Mary Steenburgen) — have been up to during the initial pandemic lockdown. Sharon's retired, Vivian and Arthur (Don Johnson) are doing so well that she says yes to his proposal, Diane and Mitchell (Andy García) are still going strong, but she decides to take her late husband's ashes to Italy with her, and Carol is caring for Bruce (Craig T. Nelson), who underwent an angioplasty. Throughout it all, they maintain their monthly book club discussions over Zoom. Inspired by The Alchemist, the four friends decide to go to Italy once it's clear to do so, which is something they've always wanted to do before life got in the way. Doubling as a bachelorette party trip, the characters bask in their friendship as they prepare for what life throws at them next.\n\nBook Club: The Next Chapter is short on plot. It's truly one long, gorgeous-to-look-at travel commercial for Italy, but one with a lot of heart. Holderman and Simms are content to let the characters go where they please, and they do just that. Yes, there is the occasional obstacle they must overcome, but it's all done at a leisurely pace, with the film taking care to showcase that not everything needs to be rushed. Even when the friends get honest with each other, the criticisms are accepted with a nod and a laugh. Anger and frustration is not something this sequel bothers too much with, choosing to go with the flow and follow what they believe are signs pointing them in the direction they need to go. It's a nice sentiment, though The Next Chapter could have definitely dabbled in a bit more conflict, if only to make things a bit more interesting and meaningful.\nThe friends all have their hang-ups about something. For Viv, it's wondering whether she should get married, something she's been adamant about not doing for so long; for Carol, it's Bruce's health, and she becomes fearful of losing him to the point of controlling every little thing. The list goes on, but the whole point of the trip is to not only spend some much-needed time together but to gain some clarity, let things go, and live life to the fullest. The film follows suit, not worried about the details or plumping up the drama for no reason. We're taken on a heartwarming ride alongside these lifelong friends, and it feels right to be able to sit in their light for a little while despite the story being paper thin.\nThat said, Book Club: The Next Chapter could have used more comedy. Bergen really nails her comedic timing, and she infuses the sequel with enough laughs to carry it through. There are certain points in the film that are frankly ridiculous, and it would have helped had they been filled with humor beyond Bergen's line delivery. Still, the film is as lighthearted as they come. With good company and some lovely interactions, and breathtaking views of Rome and Venice, the cast seems to be having a blast, and it makes us want to join them on their journey.\nBook Club: The Next Chapter has a winsome cast and a fabulous location, sprinkled with story beats that keep it going. But the writing, while not containing enough to sustain it for nearly two hours, is breezy and touching, with the cast imbuing the film with their charm and lovely chemistry. The Book Club sequel will make you feel as though you're reuniting with old friends for some wine and life lessons, and that's enough.\nBook Club: The Next Chapter is now playing in theaters. The film is 107 minutes long and rated PG-13 for some strong language and suggestive material.\nLike us on Facebook to see similar stories\nPlease give an overall site rating:",

      excerpt:
        'The Rivian R1T, an electric truck, starts at around $73,000, while the Rivian R1S, an electric SUV, starts at around $78,000. Neither of them are eligible for the full federal tax credit, but even if…',
      summary:
        "The Rivian R1T, an electric truck, starts at around $73,000, while the Rivian R1S, an electric SUV, starts at around $78,000. Neither of them are eligible for the full federal tax credit, but even if they were they would still be expensive vehicles, by any definition of the word. Rivian, apparently, is fine with that, according to a report on Wednesday from Reuters. The EV maker is not about big volume, you see, but something called profits.\nRivians — at least the ones on offer today — are not meant to be volume products, its CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters. They are luxury products, and priced as such.\n'We see demand from customers for what we're building' Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe told Reuters on Wednesday.\nRivian is confident of maintaining prices in the face of growing competition, he said, adding that extra-large batteries, better performance and premium features would distinguish the company from rivals.\n'Given the data that we have on customer behavior, the aggregate result we see is a continued upward shift in ASPs,' he said. 'We will offer a lower priced variant, but not necessarily lower prices on the things we're offering today.'\n[...]\n'These are flagship products,' Scaringe said of Rivian's offering. 'These are the products that are building our brand. They're not meant to sell hundreds of thousands of units.'\nRivian aims to produce 50,000 vehicles this year.\nThis is perhaps merely a function of Rivian's production constraints — I don't doubt for a second that Scaringe wouldn't like to sell hundreds of thousands of units a year — but still is interesting nonetheless in the wake of Tesla's price shenanigans this year. Indeed, Reuters quotes an investment guy that says that Rivian should increase their prices now, because there is currently more demand than supply, something that doesn't seem in the cards but shows you where Wall Street's head is at.\nThe fact is that Rivians are expensive cars, and a move a few thousand dollars down wouldn't change that. Long-term, this doesn't seem to matter, as Rivian hasn't had the sorts of short-term demand issues that a startup like Lucid has had, nor taken much of a brand hit as it struggles with production. Short-term, Rivian will keep being asked this question because of Tesla's price moves, even though Tesla doesn't sell an electric truck.\nAnd then there is heat from traditional players in the industry, though Rivian and Scaringe have gotten to where they are now largely ignoring the noise, so why start now.\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

      summary:
        "CINCINNATI (AP) — The New York Mets committed to paying nearly half a billion dollars in player contracts this offseason in their pursuit of a World Series title.\n\nThe problem is it's not paying off.\n\nFor the first time since 2012, the Mets have dropped five series in a row. The Cincinnati Reds erupted Thursday for four first inning runs against Kodai Senga and beat New York 5-0, taking two of three in the series. Spencer Steer added an insurance solo shot in the fifth inning.\n\nJonathan India, Jake Fraley and Tyler Stephenson each had two hits for the Reds (16-21), who sent the Mets (18-20) to their fourth loss in five games and 13th in 17.\n\nNew York has been shut out seven times, one fewer than all of last season. Cincinnati pitchers had just one previous shutout this year, on April 15 against Philadelphia.\n\n'Hats off to all the teams that shut us out,' Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor said. 'I wish I had the answer for that one.'\n\nNew York has scored two runs in its last 19 innings\n\n'When you don't score runs, it's impossible to win a game,' Mets manager Buck Showalter said.\n\nNew York's previous series losses during the skid were to Washington, Atlanta, Detroit and Colorado.\n\nOn a Cincinnati bullpen day, Derek Law pitched into the second inning, followed by Ben Lively, Lucas Sims and Kevin Herget, who logged his first career save. Lively (1-0), promoted from Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday, allowed four hits with a strikeout over three innings to earn his first win since his rookie season in 2017.\n\n'I'm so fired up,' Lively said. 'My mom and my sister were here. I was so jacked up. I'm pretty riled up right now. It is surreal. I feel the circle is complete now.\n\n'They told me to be ready for the second inning. I had no idea how long I'd go. I could have gone longer. Hell, yeah, I was fired up. I felt good. That's just me. That's how I am. It was an awesome win today.'\n\nThe group didn't allow an extra-base hit until Francisco Álvarez's one-out double off Herget in the seventh. Right fielder Henry Ramos threw Álvarez out at the plate trying to score on Lindor's single to preserve the shutout.\n\nAfter giving up two hits over six scoreless innings in his previous start against Colorado on May 5, Senga (4-2) threw 37 pitches while allowing five hits in Cincinnati's four-run first inning, including four hits and a walk with two outs that produced all four runs. Kevin Newman capped the rally with a bases-loaded, two-run single. The Reds sent nine batters to the plate in the inning.\n\n'It has been our identity, the next man up mentality,' Newman said. 'The overall big team contributions. A pressure that we bring is taking the extra bag when we can. That's big for us. Getting in scoring position when normally you wouldn't puts us in a good position. The home runs are going to come.'\n\nShowalter admitted he was one more batter away from bringing in Tommy Hunter.\n\n'We had Tommy up early,' Showalter said. 'I hated to do that. There were only two balls that were hit hard. That's the way it goes when you're going through a tough stretch like this.'\n\nSenga regrouped to face the minimum nine batters over the next three innings before Steer's two-out drive in the fifth. The Reds reached Senga for eight hits and five runs with one walk and seven strikeouts.\n\n'I think I was able to control myself pretty well today,' Senga said through an interpreter. 'One thing I had in mind coming into this outing was pounding the strike zone, and I thought I did that pretty well. I threw it where they could hit it.'\n\nEIGHT BALL\n\nIndia's leadoff double extended his hitting streak to eight games (11-for-26, .423), his second streak of eight games this season and the third by a Reds player. TJ Friedl also had an eight-game streak in April.\n\nMAXIMUM EFFORT\n\nHerget's three-inning save was Cincinnati's first since Sal Romano against the Cubs on Aug. 10, 2019.\n\nON THE FARM\n\nGary Sánchez hit a go-ahead homer off Drew Hutchison and singled as part of a 2-for-3 night for Syracuse against Buffalo, a day after going 2 for 4 with an RBI grounder in his debut for the Mets' Triple-A farm team.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMets: Friday's starting pitcher at Washington remained to be determined, but manager Buck Showalter confirmed before Thursday's game that it wouldn't be RHP Max Scherzer, who was scratched from Tuesday's start with neck spasms. 'He threw from 90 feet today,' Showalter said. 'He's improving each day.'\n\nReds: 1B Joey Votto (left shoulder and bicep surgery) is scheduled to go to Louisville to continue taking live batting practice … RHP Fernando Cruz (right shoulder strain) is long tossing from 150 feet and will be with the team in Miami and Denver and is expected to make at least one rehab start before being activated, but no date has been determined.\n\n\n\nMets: Showalter indicated that RHP Tyler McGill (3-2) could be Friday's starter against the Washington Nationals. 'We're waiting to see how things shake out a little bit,' Showalter said.\n\nReds: RHP Graham Ashcraft (2-1) is scheduled to face in Miami on Friday RHP Euly Pérez, who will be making his major league debut.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "GREAT BEND, Kan. (KAKE) - The Wall That Heals has come to Kansas. It's a traveling Vietnam veterans memorial replica that travels around the county.\nThis time it's in Great Bend. KAKE News spoke to a man who visited the memorial to pay respects to his friends.\n\"That's Narciso Francis Herrera, and David, Weston David MacLean,' said Brad Hancock, a Vietnam War vet.\nVietnam Vet Brad Hancock is referring to two of his late friends who served in the war with him. He calls his two friends his brothers, and they're the real heroes in his eyes.\n\"These guys were 19 and 20 years old. And they didn't get a chance at life. This means they keep on living in a sense. They certainly continue to be with me,' said Hancock.\nHancock, seeing his two brothers' names reflects on how much life they missed out on by serving our county, giving the ultimate sacrifice.\n\"Nineteen or 20 you haven't gotten married, you haven't had any kids, you haven't had many jobs. You're in the marine corps, and you're in the infantry and you find yourself in the jungle and in combat,' said Hancock. \nThe Memorial Wall, a replica of the one in Washington D.C. is something Hancock hasn't seen in 40 years. The last time he saw the Memorial Wall was in California. Despite not seeing the one in D.C., the replica brings back memories of his time in Vietnam.\n\"Right here, Weston David MacLean, and he was killed on July 20th when we walked into an ambush together. And unfortunately, he didn't make it out. They were my friends. And so I'm glad to see they live on through this wall,' said Hancock.\nThe wall will be up 24 hours a day until 2 p.m. on Sunday, May 14th in Veterans Memorial Park.",

      summary:
        "NEW YORK (AP) — A man who kept a chokehold around the neck of an agitated fellow passenger on a New York City subway, leading to the other rider's death, is expected to turn himself in to authorities Friday on a manslaughter charge that could send him to prison for 15 years.\n\nManhattan prosecutors announced Thursday they would bring the criminal charge against Daniel Penny, 24, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, in the May 1 death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely.\n\nNeely's death, captured on video by a freelance journalist, has raised an uproar over many issues, including how those with mental illness are treated by the transit system and the city, as well as crime and vigilantism.\n\nPenny's attorneys did not respond to a request for comment after the prosecutors made their announcement. They have previously said Penny acted in self-defense.\n\nAccording to an onlooker, Neely, who is Black, had been screaming and begging for money aboard the train, but had not gotten physical with anyone.\n\nPenny, who is white, was questioned by police in the aftermath, but was released without charges.\n\nFriends of Neely said the former subway performer had been dealing with homelessness and mental illness in recent years. He had several arrests to his name, including a 2021 assault of a 67-year-old woman leaving a subway station.\n\nA second-degree manslaughter charge in New York will require the jury to find that a person has engaged in reckless conduct that creates an unjustifiable risk of death, and then consciously disregards that risk.\n\nThe law also requires that conduct to be a gross deviation from how a reasonable person would act in a similar situation.",

      summary:
        "Neil Michael Goodman, of Chevy Chase, Maryland and West Boothbay Harbor, Maine, died on May 8, 2023 surrounded by his wife and children.\n\n\nA native of Buffalo, New York, Neil was a stalwart fan of the Buffalo Bills and the Buffalo Sabres. He attended Nichols preparatory school, honing his work ethic by washing dishes in his family's businesses, including at the iconic Park Lane restaurant. Neil graduated from Brown University in 1979 with a degree in American History and an affinity for dry historical tomes. His friends from Brown, including his rowing teammates, were a source of adventure and support throughout his adult life.\n\n\n\n\nNeil went on to law school at Columbia University, graduating in 1983. After a clerkship for Judge Frank Battisti on the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Ohio, Neil became an associate at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C.  There, he was relentlessly pursued by a young legal assistant who would become his wife, but he stayed focused on his career, becoming a partner in 1991. Neil's practice in international finance evolved from his role on some of the largest sovereign debt restructurings during the Latin America debt crisis, including the representation of the Ministries of Finance and Central Banks of Venezuela, Brazil, and Panama.\n\n\nNeil was an avid runner, completing seven marathons including the New York Marathon, and he was a self-appointed coach for all of his children's athletic events. His retirement in 2021 allowed time to enjoy his family, including grandson Christopher Sweeterman and his daughters' partners David Sweeterman and John Rupp.\n\n\nNeil was a naturalist who took great pleasure in exploring the country's national parks, skiing in Telluride, and boating off the coast of Maine with his children. He tracked birds across North America, Africa, and, during the pandemic, at home in Boothbay Harbor, where an elusive Russian Steller's Sea Eagle had resettled. Neil was honored to serve on the Board for Nature Bridge, an organization that provides environmental education opportunities for children.\n\n\nNeil's spirit is held by his surviving family, including wife Emily Whiting and their children, Caroline (Sweeterman), Charlotte, and Nathan. He is also mourned by his sister Barbara and by an extended family that includes his father-in-law, Douglas Whiting, and beloved cousins, nieces and nephews.  Neil is predeceased by his parents Seymour and Marian Goodman and by his mother-in-law Charlotte Whiting.\n\n\n\n\nThe family will host a gathering at their home in Chevy Chase, Maryland in remembrance of Neil and a gathering in Boothbay Harbor, Maine at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Neil's memory may be made to So Others Might Eat or to Nature Bridge.",

      summary:
        "Completed business combination and listing on Nasdaq generating gross proceeds of approximately $70 million\nBackBeat CNT™ global pivotal study in hypertensive pacemaker patients on track for initiation in the second half of 2023 in collaboration with Medtronic\nVirtue SAB® U.S. pivotal study in coronary in-stent restenosis ('ISR') start planned for the second half of 2023 in collaboration with Terumo\nNEW HOPE, Pa., May 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orchestra BioMed Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: OBIO, 'Orchestra BioMed' or the 'Company'), a biomedical company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today reported its first quarter 2023 financial results and provided a business update.\n'The first quarter of 2023 was a transformational period for Orchestra BioMed marked by our successful entrance into the public markets. In the last year, we completed our BackBeat CNT strategic collaboration with Medtronic, the global leader in cardiac pacing therapies, and significantly strengthened our balance sheet with support from leading healthcare and strategic investors. With these accomplishments, we believe we have long-term capital resources to execute pivotal clinical studies for our two lead programs, BackBeat CNT and Virtue SAB,' stated David Hochman, Chairman, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Orchestra BioMed. 'We plan to start the BackBeat CNT and Virtue SAB pivotal studies this year and look forward to generating key data to support regulatory submissions for these high-impact therapeutic devices. It is an ideal time to be pursuing our innovative, partnership-enabled business model, and our team is focused on delivering significant value for our shareholders, physicians, and patients.'\n \nCorporate highlights\nCompleted successful business combination with Health Sciences Acquisition Corp 2 ('HSAC2'), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of RTW Investments, LP ('RTW'), on January 26, 2023. Gross proceeds from the transaction were approximately $70 million and the transaction was supported by approximately $28 million in market purchases of HSAC2 stock and investments by funds managed by RTW affiliates and approximately $10 million in market purchases of HSAC2 stock by an affiliate of Medtronic plc ('Medtronic').\nStrengthened senior leadership team with appointment of Avi Fischer, M.D., as Senior Vice President (SVP), Medical Affairs and Innovation; J.C. Simeon as SVP, Quality; George Papandreou, Ph.D., as General Manager and SVP, Focal Therapies; and Kunal Faldu as Vice President, Pharmaceutical Development.\nPipeline highlights\nBackBeat Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy (CNT™) - Hypertension in Pacemaker Patients\nGlobal pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BackBeat CNT in adult patients with hypertension who are indicated for a pacemaker on track to start in the second half of 2023\nVirtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusionTM Balloon (SAB) – Coronary Indications\nU.S. pivotal study evaluating Virtue SAB in adult patients with coronary ISR planned to start in the second half of 2023\nAdditional Virtue SAB clinical studies in coronary ISR and small vessel disease planned in partnership with Terumo, the Company's global strategic partner for development and commercialization of Virtue SAB\nFinancials\nCash Position: As of March 31, 2023, Orchestra BioMed had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $127.1 million, compared to $83.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in cash was primarily due to the net proceeds provided by the closing of the business combination with HSAC2, less cash used in operating activities during the quarter and fees and expenses associated with the business combination. Based on current clinical development and other research and development plans and budget estimates, the Company anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund operations into 2026.\nRevenue: Orchestra BioMed recognized $1.2 million of revenue for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased recognition of partnership revenues earned under the Terumo agreement.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $8.3 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with preparations for the launch of the Virtue SAB and BackBeat CNT pivotal clinical studies, as well as an increase of $0.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs, legal, insurance and finance costs, transaction costs incurred related to the closing of the business combination and included an increase of $0.9 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nOther Income (Expense): Other income was $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2023, compared to other expense of $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2022. Interest income (expense), net, increased by $1.1 million from the first quarter of 2022 due to the higher cash balance and an increase in interest rates.\nNet Loss: Net loss was $10.9 million for the first quarter of 2023, or $0.40 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.62 per share, for the same period in 2022. The net loss for the first quarter of 2023 includes $1.8 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and loss on fair value adjustment of warrant liability as compared to $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2022.\nAbout BackBeat CNT and the Strategic Collaboration with Medtronic\nBackBeat CNT is an investigational bioelectronic treatment designed to lower blood pressure. It is compatible with standard pacemakers as a firmware upgrade and has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for pacemakers. It is estimated that more than 70% of the approximately 1.1 million people globally who are implanted with cardiac pacemakers each year are also diagnosed with hypertension1.\nThe peer-reviewed, double-blind, randomized pilot study, MODERATO II, showed that patients treated with BackBeat CNT experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) when compared to control patients at six months. Orchestra BioMed plans to conduct a global pivotal study to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of BackBeat CNT in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently received, a cardiac pacemaker implant. The strategic collaboration with Medtronic will provide Orchestra BioMed with development, clinical, and regulatory support for this planned global study. Upon regulatory approval, Medtronic will have the global rights to commercialize BackBeat CNT-enabled pacing systems for this target population. Orchestra BioMed will share in the revenues generated from Medtronic sales of the BackBeat CNT-enabled pacing systems.\nAbout Virtue SAB and the Strategic Collaboration with Terumo\nVirtue SAB is a patented drug/device combination product candidate in development for the treatment of certain forms of artery disease that is designed to deliver a proprietary, investigational, extended-release formulation of sirolimus, SirolimusEFR™, to the vessel wall during balloon angioplasty without any coating on the balloon surface or the need to leave a stent or other permanent implant in the artery. Virtue SAB demonstrated positive three-year clinical data in coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) in the SABRE study, a multi-center prospective, independent core lab-adjudicated clinical study of 50 patients conducted in Europe. Virtue SAB has been granted Breakthrough Device designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for specific indications relating to coronary ISR, coronary small vessel disease and peripheral artery disease below-the-knee.\nUnder the terms of their collaboration agreement, Orchestra BioMed and Terumo plan to execute a global clinical program in an effort to gain regulatory approval for commercial sale of Virtue SAB in multiple markets and indications. Terumo made an upfront payment of $30 million to Orchestra BioMed and Terumo will potentially make additional future clinical and regulatory milestone payments. Orchestra BioMed will share meaningfully in future commercial revenues of Virtue SAB through royalties and per unit payments as the exclusive supplier of SirolimusEFR. Orchestra BioMed retains the rights to develop and license SirolimusEFR and other technologies used in Virtue SAB for clinical applications outside of coronary and peripheral vascular interventions.\nAbout Orchestra BioMed\nOrchestra BioMed (Nasdaq: OBIO) is a biomedical innovation company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships with leading medical device companies. Orchestra BioMed's partnership-enabled business model focuses on forging strategic collaborations with leading medical device companies to drive successful global commercialization of products it develops. Orchestra BioMed's flagship product candidates include BackBeat Cardiac Neuromodulation Therapy™ (CNT™) for the treatment of hypertension, a significant risk factor for death worldwide, and Virtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusion™ Balloon (SAB) for the treatment of atherosclerotic artery disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Orchestra BioMed has a strategic collaboration with Medtronic, one of the largest medical device companies in the world, for development and commercialization of BackBeat CNT for the treatment of hypertension in pacemaker-indicated patients, and a strategic partnership with Terumo Corporation, a global leader in medical technology, for development and commercialization of Virtue SAB for the treatment of artery disease. Orchestra BioMed has additional product candidates and plans to potentially expand its product pipeline through acquisitions, strategic collaborations, licensing, and organic development.

      summary:
        'Thirteen people dead in two mass shootings. Eight immigrants killed when an SUV slams into a crowded bus stop. The likely approval of legislation that would let the Republican governor overturn elections in the most populous county, a Democratic stronghold. All in the past two weeks.\n \nThese issues and the forces behind them - anger and guns, immigration turmoil, deep political divisions about what democracy means - are playing out across American life in various ways. But in Texas, with its immense size and a population that grows by more than 1,000 people a day, the stage is far bigger - and often louder.\n \nIt\'s enough to make even the proudest Texan wrestle with how he sees the state.\n \n"This is out of control right now," said Jay Leeson, an illustrator and cartoonist who lives in Lubbock, a city in the Texas High Plains. He describes himself as a "conservative West Texan" whose kids "know how to handle guns, know how to ride horses, know how to do all the Texas things."\n \nThe "Texas things." Texans have heard this all before. They\'ve been hearing it for generations. That everyone is armed. That it\'s a wildly conservative place full of oil roughnecks and cowboys and brash braggarts. That it\'s nothing like the rest of the country, really.\n \nMany Texans will tell you there\'s some truth to this. But Texas is also far more nuanced than a collection of clichés that consider the state through the narrowest of lenses.\n\n\n \nNews from around the state of Texas.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYet lately, things here have felt unrelenting. And what troubles some Texans is not how outsiders see the state, but whether those living here can navigate the divisive political climate - and overcome a complicated and sometimes violent past.\n \nLeeson is furious at how immigration has become a political battleground. He\'s furious at how Republicans "bleed every vote they can out of West Texas" to overcome growing populations in the state\'s heavily Democratic urban centers, from Houston to , Austin to San Antonio. The Texas Legislature is currently debating various bills that are targeting how Democratic Harris County, the state\'s most populous, runs its elections.\n \nHe\'s especially furious that his 9-year-old son is so worried about school shootings that he checked all the windows in his classroom to see which would open in case of an attack.\n \n"I just think the whole thing is a damn mess," Leeson said.\n \nMass killings have a deep history in Texas. Arguably the first modern American mass shooting happened here in 1966, when an engineering student opened fire from a building observation deck at the University of Texas. He killed 14 people and wounded dozens more.\n \nBut the state\'s strict gun laws didn\'t begin to crack until a few years after another mass shooting - this one in 1991, when a gunman drove his pickup truck through the window of a central Texas cafeteria and killed 23 people. By then, decades of Democratic control were giving way to Republicans who saw gun rights as a key issue.\n \nIn 1995, then-Gov. George W. Bush signed legislation that allowed Texans to carry concealed guns. Today, Texans can carry weapons openly. Some do - passionately.\n \nChad Hasty, a well-known conservative talk radio host based in Lubbock, mourns the latest killings - "I don\'t want to get to a time where we\'re not shocked by a mass shooting" - but is adamant that gun rights be protected. He rarely leaves home without his Sig Sauer P365, a small firearm designed for everyday carrying and one of the best-selling pistols in America.\n \nHe dismisses the idea that Texas is particularly prone to violence.\n \n"I don\'t view it as a uniquely Texas thing," he said. Instead, the number of mass shootings is simply a matter of size: "We\'re a huge state - millions and millions of people."\n \nThe litany of Texas\' mass killings in just the last few years is staggering: Sutherland Springs, 26 killed in 2017; Santa Fe, 10 killed in 2018; El Paso, 23 killed in 2019; Midland-Odessa, seven killed in 2019; Uvalde, 21 killed in 2022; Cleveland, five killed on April 28; Allen, eight killed on May 6.\n \nGuns have long been a part of Texas culture - both in the state\'s mythology and in reality. But to equate the number of guns with the number of people killed by guns strikes some as a false equivalence.\n \n"You\'ll never get people to give up their guns, nor do I believe you should," said Vanesa Brashier, the editor and publisher of Bluebonnet News, a site that covers rural areas north of Houston, including the town of Cleveland, where five immigrants were killed in a mass shooting on April 28.\n \nShe was deeply shaken by the killings, particularly by how some of the women died shielding their children from gunfire. But she considers herself pro-Second Amendment: "I want to be able to defend myself if someone comes calling that shouldn\'t be at my property."\n \nLike so much in Texas, her politics are complex. Brashier, who calls herself a political independent, sees immigration as a good thing - "I just think we need to figure out a better way to do it."\n \nJust two weeks ago she created a Spanish language news site to better inform the area\'s growing Latino population. She named the site "El Amanecer Texas" or Texas Sunrise, "because I wanted it to be hopeful."\n \n"These residents who have moved here deserve to be informed about what\'s going on around them," she said. But the influx of immigrants has faced backlash from some residents, who feel "like there\'s been an invasion," Brashier said.\n \nThis week, Texas and other border states were preparing for the end of a policy that allowed the government to quickly expel migrants to Mexico. Gov. Greg Abbott has deployed more Texas National Guard troops in response to the end of the rule. The goal, Abbott said this week: to "secure the Texas border."\n \nTexas\' border cities have tended to be more welcoming to immigrants than other parts of the state, since many in these areas have long seen themselves and their Mexican neighbors as a big, blended community that transcends governments\' political borders. In El Paso, for instance, more than 80 percent of nearly 700,000 residents are Latino. Many residents have family just across the border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n \nThis situation at the border has created a welcoming community that reacts differently to various issues, including immigration, said Richard Pineda, director of the Sam Donaldson Center for Communication Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso. For Texas, he says, it\'s an outlier - a "fluid culture that goes back and forth."\n \nTexas can feel like a study in contrasts. Famed for its oil industry, but the producer of a quarter of the country\'s wind energy and a leader in solar power. Known for its open, undeveloped landscapes but home to some of the largest, fastest-growing cities in the land. Epitomized by the cowboy, but with some of the largest immigrant populations in America.\n \nWith more than 30 million people, Texas has long been a destination for outsiders from other U.S. states and abroad. Since 2010, it has gained nearly 4 million residents - more than any other state, according to U.S. Census figures. In 2020, Latino residents accounted for half the population growth, and many demographers believe Latinos will soon surpass whites as the state\'s largest ethnic group.\n \nBut it\'s not just Latinos. Texas has large populations of immigrants from India, China, the Philippines, Vietnam and elsewhere. Allen, where a gunman killed eight people at a mall on May 6, is among the -Fort Worth area\'s most diverse suburbs.\n \nFor nearly a century, Texas has had a one-word state motto: "Friendship." But many see that easygoing connection changing.\n \n"I always thought of Texas as a friendly place. But to be honest, this last decade, it just feels meaner," said Chris Tomlinson, a fifth-generation Texan and a business columnist with the Houston Chronicle. He has written two best-sellers about Texas history, including "Forget the Alamo: The Rise and Fall of an American Myth."\n \nTomlinson notes that more than 70 percent of Texans over age 60 are non-Hispanic whites, while more than 70 percent of Texans under age 30 are people of color.\n \n"That creates the tension that you see around voting rights and cultural issues like critical race theory and LGBTQ issues," he said. "When you have that level of demographic change, there is going to be tension."\n \nTexas is among the states, for example, where drag shows have been targeted by right-wing activists and politicians, and Republican lawmakers have proposed restrictions on the shows.\n \nAt times, it can seem that the Texas population is shifting faster on many issues than the state\'s politics, which remain solidly conservative and Republican. A Democrat hasn\'t been elected to statewide office since 1994. Yet Tomlinson notes that polling indicates Texans aren\'t that different from the rest of the country when it comes to many issues, from abortion to immigration.\n \nThen there are the guns - a reputation that, for better and worse, follows Texas everywhere. A survey last year by the University of Houston and Texas Southern University showed "overwhelming support" for at least some level of gun control. Yet few expect to see that in Texas anytime soon.\n \nGary Mauro, a longtime commissioner of the Texas Land Office who ran for governor in 1998, is one of those last statewide Democrats. Though he reserves most of his criticism for Republicans, he blames extremists in both parties for focusing on the political fringes - and amplifying some of the very clichés with which Texas continues to struggle.\n"I keep thinking it\'s going to get better," he said of Texas politics. "And it keeps getting worse."',

        "Rock legends Fanny return with a new album and documentary film after 50 years. The group, featuring Filipina American and lesbian musicians, recently released a reunion album called 'Fanny Walked the…",
      summary:
        "On why they call themselves Fanny\n\n\nI heard of a band called Daisy Chain, and I noticed that there was a girl's name in it, and immediately I felt like I was in a room full of friends. I had company, right? And I said, 'Hey, why don't we think of a girl's name?'\n\n\nIt was a double entendre, of course, even here in the U.S. And we're kidded a lot about what it means in England, but we didn't know that. And to tell you the truth, Fanny was my avatar. She was my front person. I hid behind her. Nobody knew that I was so shy. How was [I] going to play that lead guitar, that loud lead guitar, you know? And so I hid behind her and totally shredded. That really worked for me, I have to say. I knew that my Aunt Fanny [or] my Grandma Fanny was the one who was in front of me while I just got louder.\n\n\nFrom left, Fanny bassist Jean Millington, keyboardist Nickey Barclay, singer/drummer Brie Darling, lead guitarist June Millington and Warner/Reprise record producer Richard Perry, as the band practices in the basement of their famed band home, ‘Fanny Hill,' in the Hollywood Hills, after being signed by Warner/Reprise for their first album in 1969. \n(Linda Wolf)\n\n\nOn making it big in Los Angeles\n\n\nIn fall of ‘68, we played an open house night at the Troubadour. And I remember the guy who ran the club. He was just, you know, like a lot of guys at the time, condescending, very condescending and supercilious. And let me tell you, that night is actually the best audience reaction I've ever had in my entire career because people not only clapped and jumped up and went crazy, they stood on the tables. They just went insane. All of a sudden that entire club knew we were good. And Norma Kemper, who worked for Richard Perry at Reprise, I think he had sent her out as sort of a scout. Nobody really knew anything, but she called them up and raved. And so we met him at a studio on Selma in Hollywood, played for him the next day or two days later, and he went crazy, too. So from that point on, things moved really fast.\n\n\nBonnie Raitt came into town. I had met her before and she wanted to stay with us. And that's how she started to play electric guitar. So, you know, very quickly, the networking and the fact that everyone knew that there were these chicks who could play, who lived on Marmont Lane. We played day and night. I mean, all sorts of people came over to jam.\n\n\nOn being women in the male-dominated music industry\n\n\nThere was honestly no space in anyone's brains to even imagine that they would see an all-girl band in front of them. No space whatsoever. We might as well [have] said we were going to walk on the moon. So, you know, aside from all the resistance, what we actually had to do was put a picture frame out in the air and walk into that frame so that people could see that it was happening. I can't tell you how important that is because now you see all-girl bands, you see women playing, it's a lot more common. But back then, I'm telling you, they couldn't imagine it. So we had to fill that frame. And that was a big job.\nWhen 'Charity Ball' [the band's first Top 40 hit] came out, the reviews that we got were so mixed. The condescension and the resistance was … [They wouldn't] just say, 'These girls are kicking ass, are really good. You've got to listen to them. They're going to make it big.' They would always give these sort of second guesses, you know, like, maybe they had guys playing with them in the studio. There was just a lot of disparagement. And so we noticed that just as much.\n\n\nBillboard on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, promoting a concert at the famed Whiskey for the release of their first album in 1970. \n(Linda Wolf)\n\n\nOn the pressure they felt from the label\n\n\nWe were selling 60,000 about per album, which is now really good. But, you know, they were losing confidence in us. And that is too bad because I was so tired by that time. I remember we were on the road all the time or writing or recording. You know, we didn't really have that much time to ourselves. So I was really tired. I felt really beat up. And when they asked us to wear those [skimpy] outfits, I mean, I didn't like it at all.\n\n\nWhen you look at the first album cover, that's our own clothes. We were savvy chicks, man, you know, we knew how to shop and how to dress. But Warner Brothers and their wisdom, they just decided to circumvent that. And, you know, aside from all along with all the disparaging comments that we got from the press, that was just a little too much for me. That's partly the reason why I left.\n\n\nOn recording a new album nearly 50 years later\n\n\nIt felt kind of effortless because, you know, every time we got together, we would have a lot of fun. We would jam and we would write songs. We really felt like we were 16, 17 again, except with more chops and a lot more knowledge. So that made it a lot easier. You know, we got the job done and we knew we could, [which] was really incredible.\n\n\nFanny bassist Jean Millington (left) and lead guitarist June Millington recording their reunion album, ‘Fanny Walked the Earth.' \n(Courtesy Bobbi Jo Hart)",

        'Ke Huy Quan could barely contain his joy when he met President Joe Biden at the White House.\nQuan, who was at the White House for a screening of his new Disney+ series, "American Born Chinese," practically jumped up and down when he saw Biden in person.\nIn a video that \nBiden shared on Twitter\n, the Oscar-winning actor for "Everything Everywhere All At Once," runs towards the president saying, \'Mr. President, hi!"\nBiden, appearing to be caught off guard, jokes, "Who the hell is this guy?" Then he looks at Quan\'s wife and asks, "Are you with him?" \n"Yes, yes," Quan replies, while ushering his spouse over. "This is my wife, Echo!" \n"It\'s such an honor to meet you," Biden says while shaking her hand, and then Quan\'s. \n"What an honor this is," Quan replies back.\nAfter the trio take pictures together, Quan then asks the president if he could take a selfie with him, saying it "would be the selfie of all selfies." At that point, Biden grabs Quan\'s phone and takes a selfie with the "Goonies" actor. \nBiden, who shared the whole interaction on \nTwitter\n, captioned it, "Little did Ke know he was dealing with a selfie expert."\n"Thats a pretty good selfie, I must admit!" one person commented on \nTwitter\n. \nTheir interaction didn\'t end there. Quan also introduced the president at the event, which helped celebrate Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month at the White House.\nDuring \nhis speech\n, Biden spoke about Quan\'s career and said he remembered him the most from his work as a breakout child performer in 1984 movie, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" which Steven Spielberg directed. \nAfter a \nfew movies and TV shows\n, Quan stepped back from acting. Biden said that Quan\'s time finally came when he appeared in "Everything Everywhere All At Once" and won an Oscar for best Supporting role.\n"Your time did come, as it has for the entire community — a diverse community of cultures that are reflected in every part of American life, including in government — by the way, a government led by Kamala Harris, an Indian American," he said as the crowd cheered, "represented by a record number of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders all across my Cabinet, my White House, the entire administration."\nQuan can file this away with his impressive collection of selfies, which he documents on Instagram. "I have a nephew who loves to collect Pokémon cards. Me? I feel so blessed to be able to collect celebrity selfies," he wrote, \ncaptioning a whole batch of them\n.',

      excerpt: 'The stunning new paint scheme is a fine replacement for its highly-regarded predecessor.',
      summary:
        "has unveiled an eye-catching new livery for one of its aircraft, replacing the much-loved and recently retired 'Salmon-Thirty-Salmon II' scheme on the same airframe. The new livery celebrates Alaskan indigenous peoples, their language, and their culture.\n has just unveiled its newest aircraft paint theme. Replacing the much-loved 'Salmon Thirty-Salmon II' scheme, which was retired just last month, the same airframe has now appeared from the company's hangar sporting an all-new design but still based on the same water-borne creature.\nThe new color scheme, named 'Xáat Kwáani,' was designed by the talented Alaska Native artist Crystal Kaakeeyáa Rose Demientieff Worl. Xáat Kwáani means 'Salmon People' in the Alaskan Tlingit language and refers to the spiritual link between the people who interact with the beloved salmon and all those who benefit from the species' stewardship of the environment.\nUsing a design technique known as Northwest Coast formline art, the salmon design by Worl is a one-of-a-kind work that honors salmon, culture, artistic expression, and language. Traditional formline art dates back thousands of years and is a two-dimensional design style of the Northwest Coast.\nAccording to an official  statement, as a tribute to the Xáat Kwáani people, the special Boeing 737-800 (tail number N559AS) is the first of any US domestic airline fleet to be named in an Alaska Native language and to depict the ancestral importance of salmon through Northwest Coast formline art.\nThe livery on the recently repainted aircraft also represents the first time  has featured a language besides English on the fuselage of any of its aircraft.\nThe Boeing 737 has been completely stripped of its previous salmon-based scheme and is now resplendent in a combination of blue shades. Depicted across the entire fuselage length is the stylized image of a complete salmon in white, with a further salmon diving down the vertical stabilizer.\nThe eye-catching scheme is highlighted with splashes of pink on various specific points of the salmon imagery and is finished off with small 'Alaska' titles along the window line, rear of the wing. The winglets also replicate the stylized salmon image depicted on the tail.\nFurther facts about the new livery are that it took 117 gallons of paint to complete the livery, with the four main colors being Midnight Blue, Atlas Blue, White, and Pink. From landing to take-off, it took just 12 days to paint, and the special livery will fly for several years through a paint system that applies a protective clear coat over the base coats.\nHere is a short timelapse video that depicts the complete repainting process of N559AS into its new scheme.\nUnveiling the new color scheme, Marilyn Romano, Regional Vice-President of , said\nCrystal Worl has a love of monumental art - most recently, murals gracing the sides of buildings in Juneau and Anchorage for locals and visitors to enjoy. And we had a large blank canvas with a 737-800. During our first conversation, Crystal shared her desire to paint an  plane, as she has flown with us most of her life. Salmon as a focus was intentional, and Crystal shares the relationship between salmon and Native people through storytelling and artistic design.'\nCrystal Kaakeeyáa Rose Demientieff Worl is Tlingit Athabascan from Raven moiety, LukaaxÌ±.ádi Sockeye Clan, from the Raven House and is Deg Hit'an Athabascan (on her mother's side) from Fairbanks, Alaska, and Filipino. Through her art, Worl aims to bring attention to Indigenous culture and to pass on ancestral values to a new generation.\nSpeaking about her involvement in the project, Worl said,\n'Every time I looked at an Alaska plane, I couldn't help but visualize the salmon being in formline, or having some sort of design that represents identity. I can't help but look at things and see how to Indigenize them. I have high hopes this project will encourage people to learn and embrace Indigenous culture and values.'\nWorl has previously created several public art installations in Alaska, including a design on the side of a Juneau fire/rescue ambulance, a steel cut medallion installed in downtown Juneau, and a 60-foot by 25-foot mural of Tlingit activist Elizabeth Peratrovich on Juneau's downtown library building.\nLast year, Worl painted a mural 125-foot by 48-foot in Anchorage. In March 2023, Worl was commissioned to design 'The Art of Skateboarding' series of postal stamps for the United States Postal Service that celebrated the sport of skateboarding and what Indigenous groups have brought to the skating culture.\nWorl is a resident of Juneau, Alaska, as a co-owner and co-designer of a design company with her brother. The company (Trickster Company) promotes innovative Indigenous design focused on the Northwest Coast art and exploring themes and issues in Native culture.\nIn the video below, Worl explains more about her cultural heritage, how she designed the new livery and the significance and importance of the salmon held by the indigenous populations of Alaska.\nAccording to data from ch-aviation.com, the aircraft featuring the new scheme (N559AS) was initially delivered to  in August 2006. Like the other 59  Boeing 737-800s, it carries 159 passengers in a three-class configuration, with 12 seats in first class, 30 in premium class, and 117 in economy class.\nFresh out of the paint bay, the aircraft will begin flying later today (May 12th, 2023) with an inaugural flight from Anchorage (ANC) through Southeast Alaska. The first stop of  flight 62 will be through Worl's hometown of Juneau, the state's capital, before continuing through Sitka, Ketchikan, and onward to its final destination of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA).\nAfter  announced earlier this year that it would soon be retiring the 'Salmon Thirty Salmon II' livery on N559AS, over 2,000 aviation enthusiasts signed a petition asking  to keep its iconic special livery, but to no avail.\nHowever, the airline revealed that it would soon unveil the aircraft's new livery, which it said would \"celebrates the culture and people of Alaska and our connection to the places we fly.\"\nThe airline will be hoping that those 2,000 petitionees (and others) will be pleased with the aircraft's latest stunning transformation.\nWhat are your thoughts on the new color scheme? Do you prefer it to the 'Salmon-Thirty-Salmon II' scheme previously worn by the same plane?

      excerpt:
        'Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith has spent decades framing violence as a public health issue. She spoke to Morning Edition about how guns fit into that picture and what prevention would look like.',
      summary:
        'Law enforcement officials in the Cleveland, Texas, neighborhood where a man allegedly shot five of his neighbors after they asked him to stop firing off rounds in his yard. Image: David J. Phillip/AP\n \nDr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith was working in an emergency room as a medical student more than four decades ago when she realized that victims of violence were getting treated and then released — unlike other patients — without any sort of preventative care.\n"And one night, at 3:00 in the morning, a young man just very specifically said to me that he was going to go out and cut the guy who cut him," she says. "I thought, this is not adequate. My response is not adequate. My profession\'s response is not adequate." \nProthrow-Stith has played a key role in defining youth violence as a public health issue in the years since (her 1991 book \nDeadly Consequences \nis considered a classic in the field). That means focusing on prevention efforts — not only in emergency rooms, but in doctor\'s offices and schools, too. \nAnd guns are increasingly a part of that conversation. \nProthrow-Stith, who is dean and professor of medicine at the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles, remembers that when she first started out, stabbings were "the number-one way that young men were killed" in Philadelphia. The picture of violence changed dramatically in a matter of years. \n"Guns in America play a huge role, especially as we start looking at weapons of war being available and the mass shootings that are taking place," Prothrow-Stith tells \nMorning Edition\n\'s Michel Martin. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 48,830 U.S. \nfirearm deaths in 2021\n, the last year for which complete data is available. Those include suicides — which have long accounted for the majority of U.S. gun deaths — as well as homicides.\nCulturally, suicide is \nmore common\n in white America and homicide more common in Black America, Prothrow-Stith notes. But she stresses that violence in general is a learned behavior.\n"We don\'t come out of the womb ready to commit suicide or homicide," she adds. "And I think as a culture, [we need an] understanding that children who are hurt, hurt others or hurt themselves. And our job is not to give them a gun, but our job is to figure out how to help them heal."\nThe role of guns in America, as told by a doctor\nProthrow-Stith says it\'s clear that guns turn "an everyday emotional situation" into fatal encounters.\n"We know that sometimes people act differently when they have a gun in a situation, feeling invincible or escalating a situation that they might otherwise de-escalate," she added.\nAnd at least when it comes to teenagers, she says, there are some similarities in the contributing factors that can lead to homicide and suicide. \nMost homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other, whether family members, friends or romantic partners, she says. \n"I remember some youth workers saying, \'Well, it doesn\'t surprise me that he killed somebody because he didn\'t care anything about himself, so why would he care anything about anybody else?\'" Prothrow-Stith says. "If you think about that, not caring anything about yourself is a symptom of depression. It\'s a symptom of a clinical illness and should be explored that way." \nWhat preventing gun violence could look like\nHow would prevention work from a public health perspective? Prothrow-Stith uses the analogy of cigarette smoking and lung cancer.\nFirst, there\'s primary prevention, which involves informing the general public of the consequences of smoking. The second phase is helping smokers quit, and the third is treatment for those who have lung cancer. \nWhen it comes to gun violence, Prothrow-Stith says the primary phase should be raising awareness and trying to increase safety. \nThe secondary phase is about understanding the risk factors. "How do we help children who are hurt, either because they\'re victims of violence or they\'re witnessing violence, especially domestic violence or gang violence, on a regular basis?" she asks. "How do we help them heal from the anger, the guilt, the pain, but also give them the strategies to move forward?" \nPrograms like "Big Brothers Big Sisters" are a great example of a secondary intervention because they give kids distractions, purpose and opportunities. Don\'t underestimate the power of staying busy, Prothrow-Stith adds.\nShe shares the story of a high school student who, when asked how he stayed out of trouble, said he played football even though he didn\'t especially like it. Sports gave him an excuse to stay late and bail out of late-night social events as needed.\n"He had developed his own strategies for dealing with the peer pressure," she says. "Those are the things that are very, very important for kids \'in the thick\', if you will." \nFocus on what works: an assault weapons ban\nMany people are used to thinking about guns as a political issue rather than a public health issue. But Prothrow-Stith says a more productive way to talk about it would be to start where the U.S. has seen success in the past: in banning assault weapons from 1994 to 2004. \nStudies have shown \na decrease in gun massacre deaths during the decade the federal ban was in place — and an increase after it expired, which Prothrow-Stith attributes to the gun industry strategically "flood[ing] the market" with assault weapons. \nThere are many more deaths in mass shootings when high-powered assault weapons are available, she adds. \n"They are like the movies and the sequel where more people get killed in the sequel than in the first movie with these assault weapons, weapons of war," she says. "We are seeing more and more people killed with each episode." \nPractically speaking, guns are here to stay in the U.S., Prothrow-Stith says.\n"But we don\'t need assault weapons," she adds. "And I think we just zero in on that argument. And I think that\'s a matter of time." \nBack to the cigarette analogy. Prothrow-Stith remembers that smoking was ubiquitous and glamorous when she was a kid, and that it took roughly half a century after the first report on its health effects for the public understanding to follow.\nShe is confident that the U.S. will have the same transformation with guns. "It is time again to treat this epidemic, reduce our rates and stay with it," she says. "We\'ve done it before. We can do it again ... just make our children safer." \nCopyright 2023 NPR.

      summary:
        "The recent flooding that washed out some area roads also piled inches of dirt and gravel onto an Old Bath Road, Wiscasset family's driveway. Wednesday morning, May 10, public works took the deposit away, making Michelle (Chase) Bailey's day.\n\n\n'What a great town we live in. The town of Wiscasset came to my mother and my rescue,' Bailey wrote Wiscasset Newspaper via email. She explained in a May 10 phone interview, she and her mother Connie Chase live at the corner of Acorn and Old Bath roads, and neither the floodwater nor all the debris had them trapped, but the garage flooded and the driveway had dirt and gravel maybe even close to a foot deep in some spots.\n\n\n'The way the water came, it brought down all of this dirt and it just landed right in our driveway ... It was really deep near our garage and so, it was a lot ... There was just so much dirt and big rocks, I didn't know what the heck to do,' the Marine veteran said.\n\n\nBailey came home to the mess, which she was able to drive up onto to park; Chase's car was in the garage. Mother and daughter found a public works crew in the neighborhood and were told the department would be back to help with the driveway, which was good news as Bailey had no luck online getting a business for the job.\n\n\nThe crew was nearby fixing a clogged culvert – the culprit in the driveway deposit, said Public Work Director Ted Snowdon. In a phone interview May 11, Snowdon said he and two other workers took less than an hour with a backhoe and a sweeper May 10 to remove the dirt and gravel. 'It was just the right thing to do.'\n\n\nThe department put the material back into the roadside it came from, Snowdon said. He added, he appreciated the family's patience as the department had been busy addressing other culvert and road issues from the storm.\n\n\nBailey was thankful for the help. She laughed as she recalled trying to hug one of the crew members. 'I was really happy (and) grateful ... to see the town help like that, because I've lived in a lot of different places, and I've never seen a town actually help out a resident, so it was really wonderful.'",

      excerpt: 'Lopez can easily carry a film on her own, and her latest project, The Mother, is lucky to have her.',
      summary:
        "The 'movie star,' that mysterious creature whose blinding charisma pulls everyone into its irresistible orbit, is becoming an endangered species. That makes \nJennifer Lopez\n—a movie star \npar excellence\n—the onscreen equivalent of a majestic snow leopard. Lopez can easily carry a film on her own, and her latest project, '\nThe Mother\n,' is lucky to have her. \n \nThat's not to say that the latest film from director \nNiki Caro\n ('Mulan') and a screenwriting team led by 'Underground' creator \nMisha Green\n would \ntotally \nsink without its star. Like most  movies, no matter what 'The Mother' would be a perfectly serviceable thing to have on in the background while you tidied the living room or answered emails on your phone. The spy-movie setup is generic enough to follow while doing something else, and the villains' motivations are only as specific as the plot needs them to be, which is to say not very specific at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n'The Mother' was screened for critics in theaters, where the immersive setup makes the paint-by-numbers portions of the plot really stick out. A handful of odd stylistic choices also attract attention in this format: A recurring visual motif of wide-angle shots with blurred edges. \n \nOdd, jumpy edits that seem to be compensating for a lack of coverage on set. But the big screen also provides a bigger canvas for the film's picturesque locations, like wild Tlingit Bay, Alaska, the sweltering streets of Havana — and, uh, Cincinnati, Ohio. (Every spy needs a place to hide out.) More importantly, it's also more real estate for Lopez's face.\n \nFor the most part, that billion-dollar mug is set into an expression of grim determination in 'The Mother,' which opens with an unnamed FBI informant (Lopez) and her handler Cruise (\nOmari Hardwick\n) barely escaping from a bloody attack on an FBI safe house in suburban Indiana. The informant soon becomes The Mother, as the pregnant ex-spy gives birth to a baby girl while in the hospital recovering from her wounds. She has two options: Either escape with the infant and stay on the run forever, or sign over her parental rights so her daughter can have a normal life. She chooses the latter.\n \nShe never signs away her emotional commitment, however. And she continues to watch expectantly from the sidelines, waiting for the day when her past will come to shape young Zoe's (\nLucy Paez\n) life as well. And indeed, just after Zoe's 12th birthday, The Mother's friend and confidant Jons (\nPaul Raci\n) comes by her isolated Alaskan lakeside cabin with a message: Zoe is in danger. It's go time. \n \nAs with her celebrated turn as a pole dancer in '\nHustlers\n,' much of the excitement in 'The Mother' is watching Lopez in motion. She swings a knife in hand-to-hand combat. She jumps across the roofs of cars in an urban foot chase. Even the subtle movement of loading and cocking a sniper rifle while lying belly-down on a rooftop thrills when she does it, as Lopez translates her background as a dancer into gritty action choreography with the ease of a seasoned professional. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe film shifts gears about halfway in, as Zoe and her mother retreat to Mom's cabin for a hybrid bonding session and wilderness survival course leading up to the fiery action finale. 'The Mother' is arguably too long at 115 minutes, but it's difficult to say which scenes in particular could have been cut; in its quieter moments, both Lopez and her young co-star Paez give convincing performances as the gruff mentor and pouty student.\n \nIf anything, the film could have used \nmore\n of these moments, which feel real and tangible compared to the cardboard cut-out bad guys played by \nJoseph Fiennes\n and \nGael Garcia\n Bernal. Either of these men, we're told, could be Zoe's father, and it's their obsession with The Mother that drives the rest of the narrative. Get in line, fellas. \n \nOn  now.",
